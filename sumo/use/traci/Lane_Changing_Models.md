## Lane-Changing Models

The lane-changing models currently implemented in SUMO are given in the
following table.

| Attribute Value | Description                                                                                              |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| LC2013          | The default car following model, developed by Jakob Erdmann based on DK2008 (see [SUMO¡¯s Lane-Changing Model](https://elib.dlr.de/102254/)). This is the default model.    |
| SL2015          | Lane-changing model for [sublane-simulation](Simulation/SublaneModel.md) (used by default when setting option **--lateral-resolution** {{DT_FLOAT}}). This model can only be used with the sublane-extension.<br><br>**Caution:** This model may technically be used without activating sublane-simulation but this usage has not been fully tested and may not work as expected.  |
| DK2008          | The original lane-changing model of sumo until version 0.18.0, developed by Daniel Krajzewicz (see [Traffic Simulation with SUMO ¨C Simulation of Urban Mobility](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-6142-6_7)). |


Mostly, each model uses its own set of parameters. The following table
lists which parameter are used by which model(s).

| Attribute               | Description                   | Models         |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------- |
| lcStrategic             | The eagerness for performing strategic lane changing. Higher values result in earlier lane-changing. *default: 1.0, range \[0-inf), -1*  A value of 0 sets the lookahead-distance to 0 (vehicles can still change at the end of their lane) whereas -1 disables strategic changing completely.                                                                                                                   | LC2013, SL2015 |
| lcCooperative           | The willingness for performing cooperative lane changing. Lower values result in reduced cooperation. *default: 1.0, range \[0-1\]* , -1  A value of 0 would still permit changing if the target lane affords higher speed whereas -1 disables cooperative changing completely                                                                                                                 | LC2013, SL2015 |
| lcSpeedGain             | The eagerness for performing lane changing to gain speed. Higher values result in more lane-changing. *default: 1.0, range \[0-inf)*                                                                                                                    | LC2013, SL2015 |
| lcKeepRight             | The eagerness for following the obligation to keep right. Higher values result in earlier lane-changing. *default: 1.0, range \[0-inf)*                                                                                                                 | LC2013, SL2015 |
| lcOvertakeRight         | The probability for violating rules gainst overtaking on the right *default: 0, range \[0-1\]*                                                                                                                                                           | LC2013, SL2015 |
| lcOpposite              | The eagerness for overtaking through the opposite-direction lane. Higher values result in more lane-changing. *default: 1.0, range \[0-inf)*                                                                                                            | LC2013         |

| lcKeepRightAcceptanceTime | Time threshold for changing the willingness to change right. The value is compared against the anticipated time of unobstructed driving on the right.
