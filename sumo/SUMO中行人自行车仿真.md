# 行人、自行车仿真

## 行人仿真

Edges that allow only pedestrian traffic are called footpaths in the following. For edges that allow both modes, typically the left lanes disallow pedestrians and the rightmost lane allows only pedestrian. The rightmost lane is then called a sidewalk.

### 在Netedit中添加行人道

To add sidewalks to a set of edges in netedit select these and right click on them. From the context-menu select **lane operations->add restricted lane->Sidewalks**.

### Generating a network with crossings and walkingareas

过路口三种模式：

1. crossing the street with priority (zebra crossing)
2. crossing the street without priority
3. crossing the street at a traffic light
