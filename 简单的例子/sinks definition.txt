Sinks Definitions
A vehicle leaves the network as soon as it comes to a sink edge. As not all networks have sink edges defined, one can support a list of edges to be declared as sinks using --sinks <EDGE_ID>[,<EDGE_ID>]*. You may also add your sink definitions to a turn-file (XML only):

<turns>
   ... some further turning definitions as above ...

   <sink edges="<EDGE_ID>[ <EDGE_ID>]*"/>
   ... further sink definitions ...

</turns>
If you do not define sinks, the option --accept-all-destinations <BOOL> may be used to declare all edge as possible sinks.
